# 🛍️ E-Commerce Product Categorization Multi Agent System

This project implements an **agentic pipeline for e-commerce product classification** using **LangGraph, Pydantic, and LLMs**.
The system uses **Generator, Evaluator, and Mediator agents** to propose, review, and finalize product category assignments, ensuring higher accuracy and consistency than single-shot classification, such as the HDBSCAN clustering method.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Agent-based architecture** (Generator → Evaluator → Mediator → Finalizer)
* **Schema enforcement with Pydantic** to guarantee valid JSON responses
* **Chunked classification pipeline** for handling large datasets efficiently
* **Category knowledge integration** for consistent taxonomy-based decisions
* **Fallback to mediator agent** when Generator and Evaluator disagree
* **Confidence scoring** for downstream analysis

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Generator Agent**

   * Proposes a category for a product.
   * Uses taxonomy knowledge and product description.

2. **Evaluator Agent**

   * Accepts or rejects the Generator’s proposal.
   * Provides a counterproposal if rejected.

3. **Mediator Agent**

   * Resolves conflicts between Generator and Evaluator.
   * Makes the **final categorization decision**.

4. **Finalizer**

   * Logs and stores the final classification.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavieraAlmendrasVilla/Multi-agent-system-product-classification.git
cd Multi-agent-system-product-classification
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run classification on a sample

```python
test_result = agent_classify_sample(final_df, taxonomy, sample_size=30)
```

### Run full pipeline on a dataset

```python
final_result = run_pipeline_chunked(final_df, taxonomy, chunk_size=50)
```

## 📈 Example Output

```
🟢 Generator Agent running for product: "pink paper parasol"
🔎 Evaluator Agent checking product: "pink paper parasol", proposed category: Party Supplies
🤝 Mediator Agent resolving conflict for: "pink paper parasol"
✅ Finalized classification for product: pink paper parasol -> Party Supplies
```

Final dataframe includes:

* **Category** → Final category
* **Reason** → Explanation for decision
* **Confidence** → Confidence score (0.5–0.7 default)
